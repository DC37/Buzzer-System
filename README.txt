Buzzer System
=============

Quiz Bowl Jeopardy-style buzzer system on Arduino. Designed for 10 players. If any one player pushes their buzzer switch, the system will activate a sound for 1 second, and also indicate which person pushed the button. The system also prevents others from pushing their buzzer buttons while the player is active until the system is reset.
